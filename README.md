##### Tired of using drab, old school metronomes when practicing? Lighten up your next practice session with this peppy and colourful new metronome. 
#

##### Set a tempo and a time signature, and you're reading to jam! 

It uses flashing bright colours after every crotchet note, so it can be used even if audio output is not available.


All sounds used are original, and made using bfxr.net
